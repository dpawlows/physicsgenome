physics genome project

Tracks programs, courses, and content across physics departments.


Note that the repo does not include the necessary physicsgenome/settings.py file needed for the project to work.  Instead, an example file 
called tempsettings.py is 
included.  This file should be modified as necessary to make the project
run correctly.  At minimum, the correct database password needs to be 
specified.
